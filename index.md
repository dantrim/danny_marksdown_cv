## Currently

I am one of four 2020 Chamberlain Postdoctoral Research Fellows at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) (LBL).
Here I work as an experimental high energy particle physicist as a member of the
ATLAS Collaboration whose experiment --- the [ATLAS Experiment](https://atlas.cern/) --- is
based at the international laboratory [CERN](https://home.cern/), straddling the
French-Swiss border just outside of Geneva, Switzerland.
I focus on the pursuit for evidence of new physics by analyzing the proton-proton collision data delivered by
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and recorded by the ATLAS Detector.
I am also involved in the upgrade of the ATLAS Detector's silicon pixel tracking sub-system,
which aims to be installed in the ATLAS Detector in time for the start of the High-Luminosity LHC.
I am generally interested in detector instrumentation & data-acquisition systems,
frontend readout electronics & characterisation,
electroweak sector physics (Standard Model Top and Higgs physics), high performance computing &
software, and explainable applications of
machine learning in physics.

## Projects

<!--
### github

My [personal github account](https://github.com/blmoore) hosts my hobby development projects as well as listing contributions to open source tools. Examples include: shiny apps [blackspot](https://github.com/blmoore/blackspot) and [shinybrot](https://github.com/blmoore/shinybrot), as well as an R package hosted by CRAN ([mandelbrot](https://github.com/blmoore/mandelbrot)).

### blog

I write a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io/blog) where I apply R and Python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. My original wordpress blog ([benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com](http://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com)) has received over 150,000 unique visitors from 180 countries.

### EdinbR

I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I helped to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR).

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account.
